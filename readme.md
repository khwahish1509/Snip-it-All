* **Persistent State** : It automatically saves and retrieves state to/from localStorage, which is perfect for:
* Saving user preferences
* Caching form data
* Maintaining app state between page reloads
* **Type-Safe** : It's written in TypeScript with generics, so it works with any type of data
* **Error Handling** : Includes try-catch blocks to prevent breaking the app if localStorage is unavailable


function UserSettings() {
  // Persist theme preference
  const [theme, setTheme] = useLocalStorage('theme', 'light');

  // Persist user settings
  const [settings, setSettings] = useLocalStorage('userSettings', {
    notifications: true,
    language: 'en'
  });
}
